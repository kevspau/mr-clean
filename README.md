# mr-clean
clean up your taskbar/desktop/start menu


## **not done yet**

## basic stuff
- Linux support is planned, but as of right now only Windows is supported
- Only about 3-4 of the settings actually work/do something right now
- settings are in json format in the `.config` file
- this app basically lists all executables in your path(and in the custom paths that you can add in .config) and allows you to run them all from the same app, allowing ease of access and organization.
